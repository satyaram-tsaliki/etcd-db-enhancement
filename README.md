## üöÄ Abstract
This study explores optimizing ETCD operations in Kubernetes clusters by integrating alternative storage backends: LedgerDB and BadgerDB. The analysis focuses on improving performance, CPU utilization, and scalability in managing Kubernetes' distributed key-value data store. Notably, the BadgerDB implementation demonstrates higher efficiency, reduced CPU usage, and better time complexity over LedgerDB, making it a promising choice for high-performance Kubernetes clusters.

## üí° Key Contributions
- Cluster Setup & Optimization
  Set up and optimized a Kubernetes cluster infrastructure, leveraging LedgerDB and BadgerDB for enhanced ETCD operations. Developed database structures in Go to collect and analyze operational metrics.
- Performance Evaluation
  Conducted comprehensive evaluations comparing the baseline ETCD system with custom LedgerDB and BadgerDB integrations. Results were documented using detailed tables and graphs, showcasing improvements in insertion, deletion, and search operations across various cluster sizes.
- Conclusions & Future Directions
  Summarized key findings, proposed future research directions, and provided a foundation for continued innovation in scalable distributed system architectures.

## üéØ Relevance and Impact
- The optimized cluster infrastructure and the use of custom database backends significantly enhance the efficiency and scalability of ETCD in real-world distributed systems.
- Comprehensive system evaluations demonstrate measurable improvements in CPU usage, memory efficiency, and operation time (insertion, deletion, search), providing a clear path for resource optimization.
- The study lays the groundwork for future advancements, offering a practical implementation strategy for organizations aiming to improve the performance of their Kubernetes-based deployments.

## üìä Summary of Results
| Cluster Size | Store Size | Insertion Time (¬µs) | Deletion Time (¬µs) | Search Time (¬µs) | CPU Usage (%) |
|--------------|------------|---------------------|--------------------|------------------|---------------|
| 3-10 Nodes   | 16 GB      | 200 - 280           | 220 - 390          | 160 - 280        | 25% - 55%     |
| ...          | ...        | ...                 | ...                | ...              | ...           |

- LedgerDB exhibited higher CPU usage and slower operation times compared to BadgerDB.
- BadgerDB showed better CPU efficiency and faster response times, confirming its suitability for high-performance scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Kubernetes (Multi-node cluster with 32 CPU / 64 GB RAM for Master Nodes, 24 CPU / 32 GB RAM for Worker Nodes)
- Go (Golang) for developing LedgerDB and BadgerDB integrations
- LedgerDB (Append-only, blockchain-inspired database)
- BadgerDB (High-performance LSM-based key-value store)

## üî¨ Key Technical Highlights
- Time Complexity: O(log n) for insertion, deletion, and search operations
- Space Complexity: O(n) relative to the number of stored entries
- BadgerDB Advantage: Provides ACID-compliant transactions, real-time processing, snapshot support, and better CPU/memory efficiency
- LedgerDB Use Case: Suitable for scenarios requiring verifiable, immutable transaction logs but incurs higher CPU overhead.
